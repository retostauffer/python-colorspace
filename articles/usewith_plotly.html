<p>This article shows a series of different plots and figures using the <a href="https://plotly.com/python/"><code>plotly</code></a> graphing library using color maps based on the <em>colorspace</em> package.</p>
<section id="scatterplot" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scatterplot">Scatterplot</h2>
<p>The following example shows the number of motorbikes recorded by an automatic traffic counting station in the Harz Mountains (Germany), an region very popular with bikers. The number of bikes (y-axis) is plotted against the daily<br>
mean temperature (x-axis) and colored by season using custom colors from a modified version of the HCL-based qualitative color palette “Dark 3”.</p>
