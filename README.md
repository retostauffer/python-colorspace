python-colorspace
=================

A Python 2/Python 3 package mimicking the
[R colorspace](https://cran.r-project.org/package=colorspace) package.

The current package state can be seen as an **early beta**. Feel free to
test and report errors and malfunctions. The package has been ported/written
within just two weeks, please do not expect that every last detail is working
like a charm! If something goes wrong feel free to **contribute** and/or to
**report** the problems (please provide some system information if possible).

The Documentation
-----------------

The documentation is the one which might need most attention from my side.
I have kept the documentation up-to-date as good as possible while developing
the code. Nevertheless, some pages (e.g., usage examples) are still empty and
I'll try to write them as soon as I can find some time.

The latest documentation is available here:

* [python-colorspace: on ReadTheDocs](https://python-colorspace.readthedocs.io)

Feel free to contact me via e-mail (Reto.Stauffer _at_ uibk.ac.at).
