To facilitate exploring the package and employing it when working with colors,
a Tcl/Tk based is provided within the package using Pythons
[`tkinter`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) interface.

```{python}
#| eval: false
from colorspace import choose_palette
choose_palette()
```

Web App
-------

A web-app to explore the capabilities based on the R implementation
[`colorspace`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=colorspace) is available
via <https://hclwizard.org>.

1. [Palette Creator](http://hclwizard.org:3000/hclwizard)
2. [Deficiency Emulator](http://hclwizard.org:3000/cvdemulator)
3. [Color Picker](http://hclwizard.org:3000/hclcolorpicker)

The latter two do not exist as GUIs in the Python implementation, however, the
function [`cvd_image`](/man/colorspace.cvd_image.cvd_image.qmd)
allows to emulate color vision deficiencies from within the Python package. For
more information please have a look at the article
[Color Vision Deficiency Emulation](cvd.qmd).
