# Summary

The Python _colorspace_ package provides a toolbox for mapping between different color
spaces which can then be used to generate a wide range of perceptually-based
color palettes for qualitative or quantitative (sequential or diverging)
information. These palettes (as well as any other sets of colors) can be
visualized, assessed, and manipulated in various ways, e.g., by color swatches,
emulating the effects of color vision deficiencies, or depicting the perceptual
properties. Finally, the color palettes generated by the package can be easily
integrated into standard visualization workflows in Python, e.g., using
_matplotlib_, _seaborn_, or _plotly_.


# Statement of need

Color is an integral element of visualizations and graphics and is essential for
communicating (scientific) information. However, colors need to be chosen
carefully so that they support the information displayed for all viewers
[see e.g., @Tufte:1990; @Ware:2004; @Wilke:2019]. Therefore, suitable color palettes
have been proposed in the literature [e.g., @Brewer:1999; @Ihaka:2003; @Crameri:2020]
and many software packages transitioned to better color defaults over the last
decade. A prominent example from the Python community is _matplotlib_ 2.0
[@matplotlib20:colors] which replaced the classic "jet" palette (a variation
of the infamous "rainbow") by the perceptually-based "viridis" palette. Hence
a wide range of useful palettes for different purposes is provided in a number of
Python packages today, including _cmcramery_ [@cmcrameri], _colormap_ [@colormap],
_colormaps_ [@colormaps], _matplotlib_ [@matplotlib], _palettable_ [@palettable],
or _seaborn_ [@seaborn].

However, in most graphics packages colors are provided as a fixed set
(typically in rgb notation). While this makes it easy to use them in different
applications, it is usually not easy to modify the perceptual properties or
to set up new palettes following the same principles. The _colorspace_ package
addresses this by supporting color descriptions using different color spaces
(hence the package name), including some that are based on human color perception.
One notable example is the Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) model which represents colors
by coordinates on three perceptually-based axes: Hue (type of color), chroma
(colorfulness), and luminance (brightness). Selecting colors along paths along
these axes allows for intuitive construction of palettes that closely match many
of the palettes provided in the packages listed above.

In addition to functions and interactive apps for HCL-based colors, the
_colorspace_ package also offers functions and classes for handling,
transforming, and visualizing color palettes (from any source). In particular,
this includes the simulation of color vision deficiencies [@Machado:2009]
but also contrast ratios, desaturation, lightening/darkening, etc.

The _colorspace_ Python package was inspired by the eponymous R package
[@Zeileis:2020]. It comes with extensive documentation at
<https://retostauffer.github.io/python-colorspace/>, including many practical
examples. Selected highlights are presented in the following.


# Key functionality

## HCL-based color palettes

The key functions and classes for constructing color palettes using
hue-chroma-luminance paths (and then mapping these to hex codes) are:

* `qualitative_hcl`: For qualitative or unordered categorical information,
    where every color should receive a similar perceptual weight.
* `sequential_hcl`: For ordered/numeric information from
    high to low (or vice versa).
* `diverging_hcl`: For ordered/numeric information around a central
    neutral value, where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes.

These functions provide a range of named palettes inspired by
well-established packages but actually implemented using HCL
paths. Additionally, the HCL parameters can be modified or new
palettes can be created from scratch.

As an example, \autoref{fig:chosingpalettes} depicts color swatches for
four viridis variations. The first `pal1` sets up
the palette from its name. It is identical to the second
`pal2` which employes the HCL specification directly: The hue ranges from
purple (300) to yellow (75), colorfulness (chroma) increases
from 40 to 95, and luminance (brightness) from dark (15) to light (90).
The `power` parameter chooses a linear change in chroma and a slightly
nonlinear path for luminance.

In `pal3` and `pal4` the most HCL properties are kept the same but some
are modified: `pal3` uses a triangular chroma path from 40 via 90 to 20, yielding muted colors at
the end of the palette. `pal4` just changes the starting hue
for the palette to green (200) instead of purple. All four palettes
are visualized by the `swatchplot` function from the package.

The objects returned by the palette functions provide a series of
methods, e.g., `pal1.settings` for displaying the HCL parameters,
`pal1(3)` for obtaining a number of hex colors, or `pal1.cmap()`
for setting up a _matplotlib_ color map, among others.

```
from colorspace import palette, sequential_hcl, swatchplot

pal1 = sequential_hcl(palette = "viridis")
pal2 = sequential_hcl(h = [300, 75], c = [40, 95], l = [15, 90],
                      power = [1., 1.1])
pal3 = sequential_hcl(palette = "viridis", cmax = 90,  c2 = 20)
pal4 = sequential_hcl(palette = "viridis", h1 = 200)

swatchplot({"Viridis (and altered versions of it)": [
               palette(pal1(7), "By name"), 
               palette(pal2(7), "By hand"),
               palette(pal3(7), "With triangular chroma"),
               palette(pal4(7), "With smaller hue range")
           ]}, figsize = (8, 1.75));
```

An overview of the named HCL-based palettes in _colorspace_ is depicted in
\autoref{fig-hcl-palettes}.

```

## Palette visualization and assessment

To better understand the properties of palette `pal4`, defined above,
\autoref{fig:specplothclplot} shows its HCL spectrum (left) and the
corresponding path through the HCL space (right).

The spectrum in the first panel shows how the hue (right axis) changes from about 200 (green) to
75 (yellow), while chroma and luminance (left axis) increase
from about 20 to 95. Note that the kink in the chroma curve for the
greenish colors occurs because such dark greens cannot have higher
chromas when represented through RGB-based hex codes. The same is visible in the
second panel where the path moves along the outer edge of the HCL space.

```
pal4.specplot(figsize = (5, 5));
pal4.hclplot(n = 7, figsize = (5, 5));
```

## Color vision deficiency

Another important assessment of a color palette is how well it works for viewers
with color vision deficiencies. This is exemplified in \autoref{fig-cvd}
depicting a demo plot (heatmap) under "normal" vision (left),
deuteranomaly (colloquially known as "red-green color blindness", center), and
desaturated (gray scale, right). The palette in the top row is the traditional
fully-saturated RGB rainbow, deliberately selected here as a palette with poor
perceptual properties. It is contrasted with a perceptually-based sequential
blue-yellow HCL palette in the bottom row.

The sequential HCL palette is monotonic in luminance so that it is easy to
distinguish high-density and low-density regions under deuteranomaly and
desaturation. However, the rainbow is non-monotonic in luminance and parts of
the red-green contrasts collapse under deuteranomaly, making it much harder to
interpret correctly.

```
from colorspace import rainbow, sequential_hcl
col1 = rainbow(end = 2/3, rev = True)(7)
col2 = sequential_hcl("Blue-Yellow", rev = True)(7)

from colorspace import demoplot, deutan, desaturate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize = (9, 4))
demoplot(col1, "Heatmap", ax = ax[0,0], ylabel = "Rainbow", title = "Original")
demoplot(col2, "Heatmap", ax = ax[1,0], ylabel = "HCL (Blue-Yellow)")
demoplot(deutan(col1), "Heatmap", ax = ax[0,1], title = "Deuteranope")
demoplot(deutan(col2), "Heatmap", ax = ax[1,1])
demoplot(desaturate(col1), "Heatmap", ax = ax[0,2], title = "Desaturated")
demoplot(desaturate(col2), "Heatmap", ax = ax[1,2])
plt.show()
```

## Integration with Python graphics packages

To illustrate that _colorspace_ can be easily combined with different graphics
workflows in Python, \autoref{fig-plotting} shows a heatmap (two-dimensional
histogram) from _matplotlib_ and multi-group density from _seaborn_. The code
below employs an example data set from the package (using _pandas_) with daily
maximum and minimum temperature. For _matplotlib_ the colormap (`.cmap()`;
`LinearSegmentedColormap`) is extracted from the adapted viridis palette
`pal3` defined above. For _seaborn_ the hex codes from a custom qualitative
palette are extracted via `.colors(4)`.

```
from colorspace import dataset, qualitative_hcl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = dataset("HarzTraffic")

fig = plt.hist2d(df.tempmin, df.tempmax, bins = 20,
                 cmap = pal3.cmap().reversed())
plt.title("Joint density daily min/max temperature")
plt.xlabel("minimum temperature [deg C]")
plt.ylabel("maximum temperature [deg C]")
plt.show()

pal = qualitative_hcl("Dark 3", h1 = -180, h2 = 100)
g = sns.displot(data = df, x = "tempmax", hue = "season", fill = "season",   
                kind = "kde", rug = True, height = 4, aspect = 1,
                palette = pal.colors(4))
g.set_axis_labels("temperature [deg C]")              
g.set(title = "Distribution of daily maximum temperature given season")
plt.show()
```
